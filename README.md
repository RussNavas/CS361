# Rubric Converter üìù
   
   
## The Mission üéØ
Help teachers who are transitioning from Google Classroom to Canvas save time.
Remaking rubrics while not necessisarily difficult is certianly time consuming.
If there is one thing teachers do not have enough of it is time.
I hope this small tool helps you feel supported and makes your day a little easier.

## How does it work? ü§®

This web app has a python backend that utilizes the flask framework.
The backend will handle the csv file from the user and process the csv to be in the correct format for Canvas.
The user will be served the transformed csv file that can be imported into Canvas through Canvas' interface.
   
The front end of this web app is done via React a javascript framework for making responsive web apps. 
The UI for this website is a single scrolling page whith a single button to click at each step of the process.  
The hope is that this will be as straightforward experience as possible for all you busy educators.
